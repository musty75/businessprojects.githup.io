									<h2><a href="#">Unilever Canteen Ordering System</a></h2>
									<p>This was a unique project because it had a lot of employees who converge on the canteen simultaneously, causing a rush and inefficient use of the 60-minute lunch break. Employees spend only 10-15 minutes eating, while many do not get their preferred food choices due to items running out. This results in significant food waste and reduced employee satisfaction.
										We developed a new ordering system that helped to alleviate these problems, improving efficiency by 25%, employees satisfaction by 45%, and reducing food waste by 40%. This project was done using draw.io and Jira.
